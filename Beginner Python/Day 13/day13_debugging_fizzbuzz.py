# Original Code:

# for number in range(1, 101):
#   if number % 3 == 0 or number % 5 == 0:
#     print("FizzBuzz")
#   if number % 3 == 0:
#     print("Fizz")
#   if number % 5 == 0:
#     print("Buzz")
#   else:
#     print([number])

# Fixed Code:
for number in range(1, 101):
    if number % 3 == 0 and number % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif number % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif number % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(number)

# Issues: "or" had to be changed to an "and", missing the use of "elif"s, tried to print a list of number instead of just the number.
