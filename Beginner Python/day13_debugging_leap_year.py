# Original Code:

# year = input("Which year do you want to check?")
# if year % 4 == 0:
#   if year % 100 == 0:
#     if year % 400 == 0:
#       print("Leap year.")
#     else:
#       print("Not leap year.")
#   else:
#     print("Leap year.")
# else:
#   print("Not leap year.")

# Fixed Code:
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check?"))
if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
        if year % 400 == 0:
            print("Leap year.")
        else:
            print("Not leap year.")
    else:
        print("Leap year.")
else:
    print("Not leap year.")

# Issue: tried to perform the modulus operator on a string. The variable "year" must be converted from a string to an int.
